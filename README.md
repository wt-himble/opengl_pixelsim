OPENGL PIXEL SIMULATION:

Individually simulated pixels are interesting. Things like Noita or Conway's game of life almost seem alive.
Having been inspired by those two examples, I thought a good exercise in C++ and OpenGL would be to throw 
together a cellular automata simulation.

This repo is not meant to be useful by any means. The code is structured in such a way that scaling the simulation 
would prove difficult. As well, there may or may not be portions of required libraries missing from the repo.

The purpose of this repo is purely to show the code used to create the simulation. For information relating to 
cellular automata or creating something similar, I would recommend this video by John Jackson:

Does this simulation use 160mb of RAM? Maybe. But Google Chrome uses like 5GB for 10 tabs so I'm not the villain here.
